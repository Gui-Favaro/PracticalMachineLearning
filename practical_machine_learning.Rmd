The data consists of a set of readings from sensors attached to subjects performing a variety of exercises. The task is to build a model which will correctly classify activities, given unlabelled sets of readings.

Load the Caret library and set the random number generator's seed, to ensure reproducibility:

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(1234)
```


#Part I: Reading and Cleaning the dataset

First let us read the dataset. We will insert NAs from the string "NA" and empty fields. We will
also trim whitespaces in other fields so that R can treat them correctly as numeric.

```{r}
rawData <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA",""), strip.white=T)
dim(rawData)
```
